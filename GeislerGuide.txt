The objective of the game is to collect the coins (pink), and take them back to the stash (yellow cylinder in corner)
The enemy's objective is to get to this stash and steal coins.
	As a secondary objective, enemies will attack you and steal coins directly from you.
	Knocking over enemies will cause them to drop any coins that they have stolen.

One of four player classes can be chosen (changed in player class for now, select screen will be implemented later)
	Raccoon - able to knock over enemies by jumping at them (unimplemented) and carry more coins
	Squirrel - able to move quicker and activate certain traps that others cannot
	Ferret - able to move quicker and carry more coins
	Magpie - able to fly and activate certain traps that others cannot

There are multiple traps laid out throughout the map
	Electric Fan (brown cylinder behind stash) - pushes enemies away for a duration after player activates it
		(timer not yet implemented)
	Vaccuum Cleaner (brown cylinder on side opposite stash) - pulls enemies in for a duration after activated
		(timer not yet implemented)
	Glue Spill (brown square on floor near stash) - slows enemy movement significantly when laid out by player
		(player creation not yet implemented)
